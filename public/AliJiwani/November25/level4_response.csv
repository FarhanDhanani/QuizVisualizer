Honestly speaking, I am extremely delighted that you are coming to my country, as I was waiting for for a long time.
Firstly, the best time to  come here is summer because the  weather is cool, every places are green which are completely relaxing fresh and you will enjoy.

Actually, in here we have many beautiful places which are good for vacation and picnic 
like, Mazar Sharif, Beeman, takht rustam , and kabul,
whren you come here we will go all this places.

Well, in my country the weather is really cold, so you should bring some warm clothes, boots, and some afghani clothes   for yourself like Gand afghani, lebas hazaragi, and something like this.

At the end I am really happy about your decision that you want to come here
